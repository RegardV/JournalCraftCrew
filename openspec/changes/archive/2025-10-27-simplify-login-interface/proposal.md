# Simplify Login Interface - Remove Legacy Elements

## Purpose
Streamline the authentication interface by removing the artificial AI credit system references and development environment section to create a clean, focused user experience for the real OpenAI-powered platform.

## Why
Now that Phase 2 (BYO OpenAI API key system) is complete, the authentication interface still contains references to the legacy credit system and development environment setup that are no longer relevant. This creates confusion for users and detracts from the clean, professional interface we want to present.

The current login interface includes:
1. References to AI credits system (which has been replaced by BYO OpenAI API keys)
2. Development environment section that isn't relevant to end users
3. Mixed messaging about artificial vs real AI generation
4. Cluttered interface that reduces conversion

## What Changes
Clean up the authentication interface to focus solely on:
1. Clean, modern authentication (login/registration)
2. OpenAI API key management
3. Real AI generation capabilities
4. Professional, trustworthy presentation
