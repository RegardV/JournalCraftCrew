# Core App Implementation

## Purpose
Implement a complete, professional web application with splash screen, authentication flow, dashboard, and comprehensive account management functionality to establish the foundation for the Journal Craft Crew platform.

## Why
The current system has sophisticated backend capabilities but lacks a polished, complete user experience. A core app implementation is needed to provide users with a professional, intuitive interface that showcases the platform's capabilities and establishes trust through proper user account management.

**Current Gaps:**
- No splash screen or landing experience for new users
- Authentication flow exists but lacks professional presentation
- Dashboard needs enhancement for better user experience
- Settings interface incomplete - missing API key management
- No user account deletion functionality
- Lack of cohesive user journey from discovery to productive use

## What Changes
- **Splash Screen Implementation**: Professional landing page with project information and clear call-to-action
- **Enhanced Authentication Flow**: Improved login/register interface with better UX
- **Dashboard Core**: Refined main dashboard with intuitive navigation
- **Settings Management**: Complete settings interface with API key management
- **Account Management**: User profile management including account deletion
- **Navigation Flow**: Seamless transitions between all application sections

## Impact
- **Affected specs**: system (user interface), integration (user flow), workflows (complete user journey)
- **Affected code**: Frontend components, authentication interface, dashboard layout, settings components
- **Breaking changes**: None - enhances existing functionality
- **Dependencies**: Requires unified backend and frontend integration (completed)

## Technical Changes
- Create splash screen component with project information and animations
- Enhance authentication interface with modern design patterns
- Refine dashboard layout for better user experience and navigation
- Implement comprehensive settings interface with API key management
- Add user account deletion functionality with proper confirmation flows
- Create seamless navigation and routing between all application sections

## Success Metrics
- Users can navigate from splash screen to authenticated dashboard seamlessly
- Authentication completion rate > 90%
- Settings interface usage rate > 80% of active users
- User satisfaction with account management > 90%
- Average time to complete core user journey < 3 minutes
- Professional presentation increases user trust and engagement
