# OpenSpec Change: Add Archon Knowledge Base Integration for Development Process

## Why
Enable intelligent development assistance through Archon's knowledge base and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities to provide developers with research-backed technical guidance, architecture decisions, and implementation best practices for building the Journal Craft Crew platform.

## What Changes
- Integrate Archon knowledge base API for development research and technical guidance
- Add RAG capabilities for development assistance and architecture decision support
- Implement development assistant service for technical research
- Add development guidance endpoints for backend and frontend implementation
- Create tools for researching file storage solutions (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
- Research authentication patterns (Firebase, OAuth, JWT)
- Investigate deployment strategies and VPS hosting solutions

## Impact
- Affected specs: integration, deployment, system
- Affected code: development tools, build scripts, documentation generation
- New dependencies: Archon API client, development assistant service
- Developer workflow enhancement with knowledge-backed guidance
