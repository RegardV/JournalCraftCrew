# Session Start Guide - OpenSpec-Aligned Development

**Always start here when beginning development work**

---

## 🎯 **Development Process Reminder**

### **Two-System Architecture (Never Forget):**
- **Development Process**: OpenSpec + Archon → Build intelligent tools
- **End Product**: React + FastAPI + CrewAI → Create user value

### **Golden Rule:**
> **Never code without research, never research without documentation**

---

## 🚀 **Session Startup Checklist**

### **Step 1: Review Current State (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Check current OpenSpec status
openspec status --show-current

# Review recent changes
cat OPENSPEC_ALIGNMENT_COMPLETE.md

# Check running services
ps aux | grep -E "(unified_backend|npm.*dev)"
```

### **Step 2: Set Development Context (2 minutes)**
```bash
# Activate development environment
cd journal-platform-backend && source .venv/bin/activate

# If starting new work: Research first
archon mcp search "your-topic best practices"

# For existing work: Review tasks
openspec tasks --current
```

### **Step 3: Follow OpenSpec-First Workflow**
```bash
# 1. Plan before code
openspec proposal create "your-feature"

# 2. Research implementation
archon mcp search "implementation details"

# 3. Create informed tasks
openspec task breakdown --with-archon-research

# 4. Implement with confidence
# (Your coding work here)

# 5. Document decisions
openspec change apply --include-archon-findings
```

## 🔧 **Available Development Tools**

### **Archon Research Commands:**
```bash
python dev_assistant_cli.py storage          # File storage research
python dev_assistant_cli.py auth              # Authentication patterns
python dev_assistant_cli.py deployment        # Deployment strategies
python dev_assistant_cli.py architecture "topic"  # Architecture guidance
python dev_assistant_cli.py patterns "tech" "use-case"  # Implementation patterns
```

### **OpenSpec Commands:**
```bash
openspec proposal create "name"               # Create structured proposal
openspec task add --research-backed "task"     # Add informed task
openspec change apply --with-archon-research   # Document research-backed changes
openspec status --show-blocking               # Check project status
```

## 📋 **Quality Gates**

### **Before Committing:**
- [ ] OpenSpec task created with research references?
- [ ] Archon research conducted for implementation?
- [ ] Documentation updated with findings?
- [ ] Architecture decisions recorded?

### **Before Closing Session:**
- [ ] Tasks marked as completed with research notes
- [ ] OpenSpec changes applied with documentation
- [ ] Session progress recorded
- [ ] Next session planned with research items

---

## 🎯 **Key Reminders**

### **What We Built:**
1. **Archon Development Assistant** - Research-backed technical guidance
2. **Journal Creation Platform** - CrewAI-powered user product
3. **OpenSpec Integration** - Structured development process
4. **Perfect Architecture Separation** - Development tools vs. user features

### **Never Forget:**
- **Archon** = Development process assistance (NOT end-user features)
- **CrewAI** = End product for journal creation (NOT development tools)
- **OpenSpec** = Structured project management
- **Research** = Always precedes implementation
- **Documentation** = Always follows implementation

## 🔄 **Session Handoff Template**

When ending a session, leave this note for your future self:

```
## Session Summary - [Date]

### What I accomplished:
- [ ] Task completed with Archon research
- [ ] OpenSpec documentation updated
- [ ] Implementation patterns documented

### Next session priorities:
1. Research: [topic] using archon mcp search
2. Implement: [specific task] with discovered patterns
3. Document: findings in OpenSpec change

### Context files to review:
- OPENSPEC_ALIGNMENT_COMPLETE.md
- openspec/changes/add-archon-knowledge-base-integration/
- Current task list: openspec tasks --current
```

## ⚡ **Quick Reference Commands**

```bash
# Development research (use daily)
python dev_assistant_cli.py storage
python dev_assistant_cli.py auth
python dev_assistant_cli.py deployment

# Project management (use for features)
openspec proposal create "feature-name"
openspec tasks --current
openspec status

# Architecture guidance (use when stuck)
archon mcp search "your-problem best practices"
python dev_assistant_cli.py architecture "your-context"
```
